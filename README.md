# Dijkstra-Visualization
Simple Dijkstra visualization in JS + HTML

# How to use
The green cell is the staring point. Click on a cell to turn it into a wall. Right click a cell to set de target and the algorithm will start automatically. In the end you will see the shortest path in green.

# Trick
I started with Dijkstra in mind, then I find out that I don't have consts, so Dijkstra turns into BFS. Then I have a simple matrix, so the BFS turns into Lee Algorithm :)
